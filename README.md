# Seltahn
Seltahn is a hobbyist's recursive descent C compiler, built from scratch for educational and research purposes.

"Seltahn" means "one who writes" in the fictitious language called [D'ni](http://www.eldalamberon.com/dni_dict.htm).

# Features
 * Should be able to compile itself (a.k.a. bootstrapping)
 * Generates position independent code (so no relocation is ever needed).
 * Only the basics of C will be implemented (no wide char support, etc).
 * Will add general purpose improvements to the C language.
 
# Modifications
 * The *goto* keyword will not be supported, together with labels.
 * [K&R C style function definitions}(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#K.26R) will not be supported.

# Used Sources
 * ANSI C89 Grammar: https://www.lysator.liu.se/c/ANSI-C-grammar-y.html
